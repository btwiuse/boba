/**
 * URL helpers for hosting boba behind a path-prefix reverse proxy.

 * Deriving endpoint URLs from the document's baseURI (instead of
 * hardcoded "/ws", "/wt", "/cert-hash") keeps the page working when the
 * index is served at a non-root path — e.g. an nginx `location /terminal/`
 * that proxies to the boba server root. The browser resolves the
 * relative paths against the current document, and the proxy strips the
 * prefix before forwarding.
